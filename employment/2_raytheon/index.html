I was considered a subject matter expert on my team. I primarily worked in C++, Python and MATLAB. I focused on general debugging and software maintenance, refactoring efforts for existing code, implementing new algorithms for signal processing, networking and server configuration, updates of the signal processing architecture, and front-end and back-end software solutions for various radar systems.</p> </body></html>
