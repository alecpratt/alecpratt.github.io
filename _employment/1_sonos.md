**Description**: As a software engineer intern I designed and implemented a robust logging application to track Sonos Control API messages between devices and the cloud using C++ in Linux. I developed a tool that paired with the logging application leads to faster bug reproducibility and triage. This improves the developer experience in fixing issues related to a new app rollout, leading to quicker resolution of customer-facing problems. I also worked on 15 stories to modify software communication protocols for real-time music and user interaction.
