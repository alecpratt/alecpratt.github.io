I am going to write here about my interests in fitness (gym, pickup basketball, running, etc). I am going to write about my liking of Penn State football and Boston Red Sox. This should be two sub sections (my fitness and sports teams)

For now, using markdown headers should be enough.  If I want to not use markdown for subcategories, I can create a data structure in the front matter that contains subcategories + content per subcategory to be parsed in the template.
