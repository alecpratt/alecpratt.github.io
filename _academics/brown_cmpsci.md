**Description:** Study of Artificial Intelligence requires expertise in multiple discplines ranging from understanding of hardware, software, and algorithms. Since undergraduate, my interests have  been in resource constrained computing. I have spent two years at Brown University in the Master of Science in Computer Science program to better prepare myself to tackle new challenges related to AI running on edge devices. My central focus of study at Brown University is split among two pathways: Artificial Intelligence and Computer Architecture.

In pursuit of the Artificial Intelligence pathway, I have taken Computing at Scale as a cross-registered student at Harvard University. This course offers a deep dive into machine learning technology and different novel approaches to optimize machine learning technology in areas including: energy efficiency, temporal efficiency, and cost. Additionally, I plan to take Hardware Architecture for Deep Learning in the Spring of 2025.

For my work in Computer Architecture, I have taken Embedded Microprocessor Design, Multiprocessor Synchronization, and Design of Computing Systems. Based on my success in these courses, I have been a Teaching Assitant for two Computer Architecture related courses, and I plan to be a Teaching Assitant for a third in the Spring 2025 semester. 

Something I greatly appreciate about Brown University is the openess for students to design their own curriculum. As a result of this freedom, I have taken Real-Time Systems in the Music Department, which is a course in creative programming for real-time music applications. Additionally, I hope to take Digital Signal Processing in the Spring 2025 semester. Brown University has a term called "vagabonding", which allows a student to attend courses without paying, but the course does not appear on their transcript. Because of my interest in music technology, I plan to vagabond a gradute course in the music department, Designing and Playing Alternate Controllers, in the Spring 2025 semester. The final project of this course is to design the hardware and software for an embedded electronic music controller to be used for performance.
