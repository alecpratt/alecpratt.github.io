Performers at concerts and music festivals have impressive music that is met with equally impressive displays of visuals, that when coupled, create superb audio-visual experiences. The cost of these visuals and Visual Disc Jockeys may be expensive. With hope to offer industry standard, out-of-the-box, performance ready visuals at an affordable cost, the Automated Graphics for Contemporary Performance (AGCP) project was created. AGCP is a signal processing system for automated graphics that is primarily intended for contemporary electronic music performance. The overall system takes an audio input, performs various spectral analyses, and uses the results of the spectral analyses to control a graphical display using pre-defined presets. In entirety, this system enables a user to play the music they want, while outputting industry-standard, high-quality graphics.
