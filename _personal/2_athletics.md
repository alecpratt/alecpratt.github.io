Growing up I played basketball, baseball, and I ran cross country and track. Unfortunately, I have not kept up with organized sports since I left High School. However, I still try to prioritize physical fitness and I still enjoy watching certain sports teams.

##### Personal Fitness
Since the COVID-19 pandemic, I have tried to maintain a healthy workout routine. I like the saying that you can't have a fully healthy mind without a healthy body.

In general, I try to do some sort of weight training 5-6 days a week. I am currently attempting to break 225 on bench press by the end of 2024 (I think I'm there, I just need to try!), as well as push myself in all other exercises. 

When the temperature is not extremely cold in New England, I try to go for runs in the summer as well to get back to my peak shape in high school. My best 5k time is 19'05" and my best mile time is 4'53". I do not imagine myself breaking the mile time anytime soon, but long term my goal is to train for a 5k so that I can break my current PR. I also have a plan to run a half or full marathon at some point in my 20s. 

##### Sports Fandom
I am a massive Penn State Football fan. What is odd is that I really did not care about the team that much when I went to school. I think that watching the team on the weekends in the fall keeps me connected to my alma mater. Outside of Penn State Football I really do not care that much about sports. I am a Boston Red Sox and a Kansas State Wildcats Football and Basketball fan because of memories with my dad growing up.
