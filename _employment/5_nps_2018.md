**Description**: I interned with the National Park Service as a Data Systems Analyst Intern. This was an Ameri-Corps funded position. I was tasked with updating the asset database at Gettysburg National Military Park in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. I worked with the IBM Maximo API to restructure and validate the database that stored data of park buildings, monuments, cannons, and other assets. In addition to my work on the database, I assisted with IT support for the park under the head of IT.
