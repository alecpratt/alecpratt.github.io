From a young age, I have been fortunate enough to have been exposed to multiple forms of the arts. My first memorable performance experiences date back to the third grade when I was a member of the Gettysburg College Children's Choir. For information on my performance background and music production, visit the [Music](/music/) page.

##### Listening Interests
I tend to think that I have a diverse range of music that I listen to that includes: Electronic Dance Music, Broadway Music, Classical Music (Instrumental and Vocal), Rock and Roll, and Jazz. This diverse listening taste is derived from studying classical music, becoming interested in music production, being raised by a mother from the city of rock and roll, and growing up with Michael Buble on in the house. I like attending music festivals with friends and going to concerts. I have really been in the mood for EDM inspired by trance and dubstep recently, so I have been enjoying artists like Jason Ross, William Black, and Seven Lions.

##### Musical Theater
Since I love music, naturally it makes sense that I would enjoy music combined with acting as well. Both movie musicals and live theatre performances have had a profound impact on my life. I have seen dozens of live broadway productions both in New York and in other cities with travelling equity casts. Generally, I prefer shows that are less gimicky, but anything goes! A few of my all-time favorites include: The Phantom of the Opera, Rent, Natasha, Pierre, and the Great Comet of 1812, Cabaret, and Hello Dolly!.

##### Art
My family has had a profound impact on my taste of physical art. I have fond memories of my grandmother taking me to the Cleveland Museum of Art to look at the armor room and of my dad trying to teach me how to learn his skills in watercolor painting. Ever since I can remember my grandparents work has lined my walls, offering a connection back to those who are important to me. I have enjoyed going to art museums and have been fortunate to go to many of the world's premier galleries including the Uffizi Gallery, the Chicago Museum of Art, the Museum of Fine Art in Boston, and the Rijksmuseum. Generally, my favorite types of art are in the impressionism family, with my current favorite artist being Boudin. I thoroughly enjoy his portrayl of seascapes and people vacationing in Normandy.
