Dynamic augmentation scheduling for Contrastive Learning has not been researched significantly. In From DINO to DYNO, the use of a dynamic augmentation scheduler is investigated to determine whether classification results can increase on the DINOv2 model. This research encompasses comparisons to a previously tried method from Peking University and static augmentation. </p>

  <p style="display:inline; line-height: normal; margin: 0;">From walk-off homeruns to World Cup penalty shootouts, sports fanatics are particular about who calls the play-by-play for their favorite teams. Certain fans often enjoy their local or regional radio station announcers over national broadcast announcers, as they provide more specific analysis and have their own enjoyable characteristics in how they portray a vivid vision of events happening in a match. The drawback for radio listeners is that radio broadcasts are often ahead of television broadcasts for a variety of reasons, both technical and capitalistic in nature. As a result of this, sports fans cannot simultaneously witness the match aurally and visually. </p>
 
  <p>The Radio Delay Project (RDP) is a means to solve the misalignment of timing between both the audio and visual experience of watching athletics. This product uses any audio source capable of using a 3.5mm cable, and outputs the audio at an adjustable delay to allow users to listen to their favorite announcers while also watching a match on television.</p>

  <p style="display:inline; line-height: normal; margin: 0;"> Performers at concerts and music festivals have impressive music that is met with equally impressive displays of visuals, that when coupled, create superb audio-visual experiences. The cost of these visuals and Visual Disc Jockeys may be expensive. With hope to offer industry standard, out-of-the-box, performance ready visuals at an affordable cost, the Automated Graphics for Contemporary Performance (AGCP) project was created. AGCP is a signal processing system for automated graphics that is primarily intended for contemporary electronic music performance. The overall system takes an audio input, performs various spectral analyses, and uses the results of the spectral analyses to control a graphical display using pre-defined presets. In entirety, this system enables a user to play the music they want, while outputting industry-standard, high-quality graphics. </p>
