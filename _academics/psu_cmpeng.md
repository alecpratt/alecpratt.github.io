**Description:** My journey in The Pennsylvania State University College of Engineering was quite wild. Initially, I started as a Mechanical Engineering major because of my background in CAD from high school. Then, I changed to be an Electrical Engineering major for really no reason at all. While I was in the Electrical Engineering pathway, I took an introductory computer science course, Programming for Engineers in C++. This was my first programming experience ever, and I instantly became interested in software. That semester I changed to the Computer Engineering degree and I never looked back. 

At every level of coursework, I thoroughly enjoyed learning about the fundamental logic and structure of computing systems. My interests in embedded devices led me to take electives such as Microcomputer Laboratory and Microprocessors and Embedded Systems. Aspects of hardware and software design always seem like a puzzle to me, and I have always enjoyed the pursuit of solving it.

The Computer Engineering degree at The Pennsylvania State University requires that students take the introductory course pathway in three topics: Computer Engineering, Computer Science, and Electrical Engineering. As a result, students are required to take more coursework than other engineering degree programs. This may seem daunting, but taking course work in all three domains greatly impacted my thinking of how computing systems work. I truly believe that being exposed to all aspects of the development of computers has led to my interests in Computer Architecture.
