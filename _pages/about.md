Hello! I am Alexander "Alec" Pratt. Currently, I am a second year master's student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.brown.edu/) at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/). Prior to Brown University, I earned my undergraduate degrees from [The Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/) in the [College of Engineering](https://www.engr.psu.edu/) and [College of Arts and Architecture](https://arts.psu.edu/).

Originally from the historic civil war battlefield town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, I am software engineer with interests in audio and signal processing. My current academic and research pursuits lay at the cross-section computing and the arts. Areas of interest include using AI for audio mixing, mastering, and production, generative music using AI, and, effective co-design of hardware and software for AI applications on resource constrained devices.

Each page on this website contains some information about myself from a technical and non-technical perspective. Feel free to reach out via email or my linked social media!
