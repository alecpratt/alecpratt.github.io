This was an Ameri-Corps funded position. I was tasked with updating the asset database at Gettysburg National Military Park and Eisenhower National Historic Site in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, focusing primarily on the latter. I worked with the IBM Maximo API to restructure and validate the database that stored data of park buildings, monuments, cannons, and other assets. In addition to my work on the database, I assisted with IT support for the park.</p> </body></html>
