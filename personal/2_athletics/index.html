I am going to write about my liking of Penn State football and Boston Red Sox. This should be two sub sections (my fitness and sports teams)</p> <p>For now, using markdown headers should be enough. If I want to not use markdown for subcategories, I can create a data structure in the front matter that contains subcategories + content per subcategory to be parsed in the template.</p> </body></html>
