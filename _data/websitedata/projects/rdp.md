From walk-off homeruns to World Cup penalty shootouts, sports fanatics are particular about who calls the play-by-play for their favorite teams. Certain fans often enjoy their local or regional radio station announcers over national broadcast announcers, as they provide more specific analysis and have their own enjoyable characteristics in how they portray a vivid vision of events happening in a match. The drawback for radio listeners is that radio broadcasts are often ahead of television broadcasts for a variety of reasons, both technical and capitalistic in nature. As a result of this, sports fans cannot simultaneously witness the match aurally and visually. 
 
The Radio Delay Project (RDP) is a means to solve the misalignment of timing between both the audio and visual experience of watching athletics. This product uses any audio source capable of using a 3.5mm cable, and outputs the audio at an adjustable delay to allow users to listen to their favorite announcers while also watching a match on television.
