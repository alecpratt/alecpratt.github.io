I designed and created the software system for a prototype of a land mine used to train our customer. The system used signal processing techniques to analyze live signals and inputs to determine if the mine should be armed or inactive. I designed the system in C++ that used an embedded, real-time operating system. I partnered with two electrical engineers to design the physical prototype. In addition to my work on the prototype, I assisted in testing and validating various radar systems.</p> </body></html>
